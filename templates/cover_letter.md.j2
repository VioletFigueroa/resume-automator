**Re:** Application for {{ role_title }} Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the {{ role_title }} position. As a {{ basics.label }} with a background in {{ background_context }}, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's security posture.

{{ summary }}

In my recent work, I have focused heavily on practical, hands-on security operations:
{% for project in projects[:2] %}
- **{% if project.url %}[{{ project.title }}]({{ project.url }}){% else %}{{ project.title }}{% endif %}:** {{ project.bullets[0] }}
{% endfor %}

My technical foundation in {{ skills.security_tools[:3]|join(', ') }} and {{ skills.programming[:2]|join(', ') }} allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation. I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns with my passion for proactive defense and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Violet Figueroa
