Dear {{ recipient.name }},

{% if prospective_outreach %}
I’m reaching out to express interest in upcoming opportunities at {{ recipient.company or 'your organization' }}. As a {{ basics.label }} and a PRS customer, I value your commitment to {{ company_focus or 'secure operations and environmental stewardship' }}. I’d welcome a brief conversation to explore where my background in forensic data handling and chain-of-custody could support your team.

I am writing to express my strong interest in the {{ role_title }} position. As a {{ basics.label }} with a background in {{ background_context }}, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's security posture.

**Why {{ recipient.company or 'your company' }}?**

{% if summary_type == 'prs_canada' %}
Your company's commitment to {{ company_focus or 'secure operations and responsible technology practices' }} aligns with my experience in forensic data handling, {{ sanitization_standard }}-aligned data-wiping protocols, and chain-of-custody procedures.

**How I can help**
- Codify documented, auditable {{ sanitization_standard }}-aligned sanitization SOPs and verification checklists.
- Tighten chain-of-custody logging with clearer handoff points and tamper-evident documentation.
- Create simple client-facing destruction/remarketing reports (before/after device state, certs, wipe IDs).
- Produce short privacy/sustainability explainer content for customers and partners.
{% elif summary_type == 'ymca_network_security' %}
YMCA BC's mission to strengthen community foundations through health equity and belonging resonates deeply with my commitment to security as an enabler—not a barrier—to organizational success. I'm drawn to your collaborative, mission-driven culture and excited to help safeguard the systems that support vital community services.

**How I can contribute:**
- Monitor and maintain network infrastructure (firewalls, VPN, wireless, cloud) ensuring uptime and performance
- Proactively detect and respond to security incidents using SIEM tools and threat intelligence
- Perform regular vulnerability assessments and implement remediation strategies aligned with CIS/NIST frameworks
- Maintain clear documentation and communicate security findings to technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Support compliance initiatives (PCI-DSS, regulatory requirements) while enabling operational flexibility
{% else %}
Your company's commitment to {{ company_focus }} aligns with my experience in security operations, risk management, and building robust security controls.
{% endif %}

In my recent work, I have focused heavily on practical, hands-on security operations:
{% for project in projects[:2] %}
- **{% if project.url %}[{{ project.title }}]({{ project.url }}){% else %}{{ project.title }}{% endif %}:** {{ project.bullets[0] }}
{% endfor %}

My technical foundation in {{ skills.security_tools[:3]|join(', ') }} and {{ skills.programming[:2]|join(', ') }} allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation.

{% if prospective_outreach %}
If helpful, I’m available for a 15–20 minute chat this week or next. Thank you for your time—I’m excited about {{ recipient.company or 'your organization' }}’s mission and how I can contribute.
{% else %}
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.
{% endif %}

Sincerely,

Violet Figueroa
