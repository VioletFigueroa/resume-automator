**Re:** Application for Network Security Administrator Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Network Security Administrator position. As a Network Security Administrator with a background in incident response and vulnerability management, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's security posture.

CompTIA Security+ certified cybersecurity analyst with 1.5 years of hands-on expertise in incident response, digital forensics, and vulnerability management. Proven ability to communicate technical findings to diverse audiences and drive measurable security improvements. Skilled in Splunk, Wireshark, MITRE ATT&CK, and NIST 800-53. Seeking analyst or SOC roles in dynamic, high-impact environments focused on proactive threat hunting and cross-functional security communication.

In my recent work, I have focused heavily on practical, hands-on security operations:

- **P1: Network Administration:** Configured and secured network infrastructure using Nmap and Wireshark for discovery and documentation.

- **P11: Secure Architecture Report:** Designed and documented a secure network architecture for a simulated enterprise.


My technical foundation in Splunk, QRadar, Wireshark and Python, JavaScript (ES6+) allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation. I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns with my passion for proactive defense and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Violet Figueroa
