**Re:** Application for Incident Responder Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Incident Responder position. As a Incident Responder with a background in incident response and vulnerability management, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's security posture.

CompTIA Security+ certified cybersecurity analyst with 1.5 years of hands-on expertise in incident response, digital forensics, and vulnerability management. Proven ability to communicate technical findings to diverse audiences and drive measurable security improvements. Skilled in Splunk, Wireshark, MITRE ATT&CK, and NIST 800-53. Seeking analyst or SOC roles in dynamic, high-impact environments focused on proactive threat hunting and cross-functional security communication.

In my recent work, I have focused heavily on practical, hands-on security operations:

- **Capstone: Premium House Lights Forensi:** Led a simulated ransomware/extortion response, performing forensic analysis using Splunk, Wireshark, and Volatility.

- **P7: IR Plan, Playbook and Policy:** Developed a complete Incident Response Plan, including policies, playbooks, and escalation paths.


My technical foundation in Splunk, QRadar, Wireshark and Python, JavaScript (ES6+) allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation. I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns with my passion for proactive defense and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Violet Figueroa
