**Re:** Application for Security Compliance Analyst Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Security Compliance Analyst position. As a Security Compliance Analyst with a background in healthcare compliance and secure system administration, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's security posture.

Results-driven Cybersecurity Professional with strong healthcare and cloud security expertise. Passionate about access control, user record management, compliance (HIPAA/PIPEDA), and implementing secure, scalable Epic solutions for healthcare teams.

In my recent work, I have focused heavily on practical, hands-on security operations:

- **P5: Risk Management Case Study:** Performed a comprehensive risk management case study analyzing regulatory drivers and compliance.

- **P2: Report on Risks & Vulnerabilities:** Conducted a risk and vulnerability assessment, producing a professional report on security gaps.


My technical foundation in Splunk, QRadar, Wireshark and Python, JavaScript (ES6+) allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation. I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns with my passion for proactive defense and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Violet Figueroa
