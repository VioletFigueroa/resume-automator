**Re:** Application for Security Software Developer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Security Software Developer position. As a Security Software Developer with a background in full-stack development and application security, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's security posture.

Full-stack developer turned security analyst with a strong foundation in secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10). Experienced in building secure web applications using Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL. Combines development expertise with security knowledge to bridge the gap between DevOps and SecOps, ensuring applications are secure by design.

In my recent work, I have focused heavily on practical, hands-on security operations:

- **Perplexport:** Built a TypeScript/Puppeteer CLI tool to scrape and export Perplexity AI conversations.

- **TinyApp:** Built a full-stack URL shortener with secure user authentication (bcrypt, cookie-session).


My technical foundation in Splunk, QRadar, Wireshark and Python, JavaScript (ES6+) allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation. I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns with my passion for proactive defense and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Violet Figueroa
